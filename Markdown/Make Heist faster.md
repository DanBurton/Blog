My name is Dan Burton.
I have been learning Haskell
and involving myself in the Haskell community
since December 2010.
I have made several toy projects in Haskell
(see [https://github.com/DanBurton](https://github.com/DanBurton)).
I am just now completing a custom course
based on Types and Programming Languages,
taught by Racketeer [Jay McCarthy](http://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~jay/home/).
I used Haskell to implement various ideas in that book
(For example, [System F](https://github.com/DanBurton/Blog/blob/master/Literate%20Haskell/SystemF.lhs)).
I have been especially active on StackOverflow,
and am currently among the top 20 Haskell answerers of all time,
and am currently the top Haskell asker of all time
(See [http://stackoverflow.com/tags/haskell/topusers](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/haskell/topusers)).
