#Description and motivation 

##What is a type-safe URL?

URLs are strings that identify the location of a resource.
...

##Why should Snap provide type-safe URLs?

...

##Will this benefit any projects outside of Snap?

I hope so.
The main focus will be on type-safe URLs specifically for Snap,
but in the process,
Heist, a general-purpose html templating engine,
should also benefit from the enhancement.
Analysis and potential use of web-routes should benefit that project as well.

#Plan

##Goals

[Can you give some more detailed design of what precisely you intend to achieve?]
...

##Resources 

[In what ways do you envisage interacting with the wider Haskell community during your project? e.g. How would you seek help on something your mentor wasn't able to deal with? How will you get others interested in what you are doing?]
...

##Timetable and Deliverables

[What deliverables do you think are reasonable targets? Can you outline an approximate schedule of milestones?]

#Personal details and qualifications

My name is Dan Burton.
I have been learning Haskell
and involving myself in the Haskell community
since December 2010.
I have made several toy projects in Haskell
(see [https://github.com/DanBurton](https://github.com/DanBurton)).
I am just now completing a custom course
based on Types and Programming Languages,
taught by Racketeer [Jay McCarthy](http://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~jay/home/).
I used Haskell to implement various ideas in that book
(For example, [System F](https://github.com/DanBurton/Blog/blob/master/Literate%20Haskell/SystemF.lhs)).
I have been especially active on StackOverflow,
and am currently among the top 20 Haskell answerers of all time,
and am currently the top Haskell asker of all time
(See [http://stackoverflow.com/tags/haskell/topusers](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/haskell/topusers)).

As a result of the aforementioned details,
I feel I am qualified for this project due to my knowledge of Haskell,
my understanding of the type-safe URL problem,
my solid plan to solve it,
and my (clearly demonstrated) capability to
draw aid from and contribute back to the Haskell community.
